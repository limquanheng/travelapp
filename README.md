Application is created on ionic/cordova, targeted for android platforms. Backend replies on backand.

Base requirements are node.js, cordova and ionic installed.

The www folder can be used to create a ionic project for running. Note the following plugins:

        cordova-plugin-console
        cordova-plugin-device
        cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
        cordova-plugin-splashscreen
        cordova-plugin-statusbar
        cordova-plugin-whitelist
        ionic-plugin-keyboard
        uk.co.workingedge.phonegap.plugin.launchnavigator
        cordova-plugin-geolocation
        cordova-plugin-actionsheet
        cordova-plugin-compat
        
Alternatively, the RAR file can be unzipped and the project run from there.

As some features require hardware from an android device, ionic serve will not have full functionality.
